/* Curriculum data — Republic of Liberia, Senior High MATHEMATICS, Grades 10–12
   Derived from the "Maths 10-12" curriculum guide (69 pp.), 6 periods per grade
   (11 units in Grade 10, 8 in Grade 11, 23 in Grade 12 = 42 units; the guide
   numbers Grade 12 units I–XXIII, so several periods carry more than one unit).

   Same unit shape as the Elementary (data-ma.js) and Junior High (data-ma79.js)
   Mathematics files, so the GEN_MA engine renders it unchanged:
     terms[] {t,d,x} · worked[] {q,steps[],a} · drills[] {id,p} · drillLabel
     · word[] {q,a} · challenge[] {q,a} · activities[] · materials[] · assessment[]

   Every unit also carries study[] — the course text of the unit, written out
   as a block list (h3 / p / bul / num / table / rule) that follows the CONTENTS
   column of the guide it comes from, with the guide page range of each unit
   recorded in a comment above its list.

   The drill ids used here are registered by gen-ma-sh.js on GEN_MA.DRILLS,
   each with a GEN_MA.METHOD entry so every answer key states the WHY.
   Unlike the Junior High drills, most Senior High drills also return a numeric
   answer (n) so the multiple-choice sheet has options to build.

   Per the project rule, the external links listed in the source guide
   (khanacademy.com, mathway.com, quickmath.com, chegg.com, symbolab.com,
   cymath.com) are deliberately omitted: the pack must stay fully offline.
