/* Curriculum data — Republic of Liberia, Junior High RELIGIOUS & MORAL EDUCATION,
   Grades 7–9. Derived from the "Religious & Moral Education" Junior High
   curriculum guide (25 pp.), 6 periods per grade.

   Same unit shape as the elementary RM_CURRICULUM so GEN_RM renders it unchanged:

   The syllabus is expressly MULTI-RELIGIOUS: Christian, Islamic and African
   Traditional teaching are set side by side, as the guide requires, and learners
   are asked to compare them. Scripture references cited in the source guide are
   retained as text references only.

   Health explanations distinguish medical facts from religious moral categories;
   safeguarding alternatives allow non-devotional and fictional classroom work.

Twelve years later, now a grown man with children of his own, he could not put the memory aside. He traced the family through a church network and wrote to them: he named exactly what he had taken, said plainly that it was wrong, asked their pardon, and enclosed what money he could as a first repayment. He expected no reply. Six months later the shop owner's son wrote back. He said the money mattered far less than the letter, that he had waited twelve years for someone to admit it, and that he forgave him. The two men have since met twice.",
