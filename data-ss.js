   Derived from the "Social Studies Grade 1-6" curriculum guide (79 pp.), 6 periods per grade.

   Every unit carries a `study[]` block list — the course text of the guide,
   rendered verbatim on the Study Notes page (see data-ss79.js for the Junior
   High half of the same subject). `**bold**` marks the key terms; table cells
   take no markup because the renderer escapes them.

   Social Studies is a CIVIC and ENQUIRY subject, so each unit carries:

    {k:"p", t:"A single-parent family is a real family. One parent caring for children is enough to make a home, and such a family can be strong and happy."},
    {k:"p", t:"The extended family is very common in our villages and towns: grandparents, aunties and uncles all help to bring up the children and share the work of the home."},
    {k:"rule"},
    {k:"h3", t:"Gender"},
    {k:"p", t:"**Gender** means the roles that society gives to boys and girls, to men and to women. Sex is what you are born as – boy or girl; gender is what people expect you to do because you are a boy or a girl."},

    {k:"h3", t:"Roles and Responsibilities in the Home"},
    {k:"p", t:"A **role** is the work or duty a person is expected to do. A **responsibility** is a duty you are expected to carry out. In a good home every member, young or old, carries some responsibility."},
    {k:"bul", items:["**Boys and men**: fetching water and firewood, sweeping the yard, mending tools, farming, protecting the home, repairing the roof and the fence.","**Girls and women**: cooking, washing, pounding rice or cassava, keeping the house clean, caring for babies and the sick, selling at the market.","**Children**: studying, obeying parents, minding younger brothers and sisters, sweeping, washing plates, and saying the truth."]},
    {k:"p", t:"These duties are not for one sex only. Boys can learn to cook and girls can learn to farm and to lead; when everybody helps, the work becomes light and finishes early."},
    {k:"rule"},
    {k:"h3", t:"Equal Educational Opportunity for Girls and Boys"},
    {k:"p", t:"Girls and boys have **equal ability** and an **equal right to education**. Sending a girl to school brings the same advantages to the family as sending a boy."},

    {k:"rule"},
    {k:"h3", t:"Family Relationships: Love, Friendship and Care"},
    {k:"p", t:"**Love** is wishing good for a person and showing it by what you do. **Friendship** is the closeness between people who trust and help one another. **Care** is looking after someone kindly, especially when that person is young, old, weak or sick."},
    {k:"bul", items:["Speak kindly and never insult one another.","Share food, clothes and toys.","Help a sick brother or sister and tell an adult at once.","Obey father and mother, and respect grandparents.","Say sorry when you are wrong and forgive when someone offends you."]},

    {k:"rule"},
    {k:"h3", t:"People with Disabilities"},

    {k:"p", t:"**Weather** is what the sky and the air are like on one day – sunny, cloudy, rainy, windy or hot. **Climate** is the usual weather of a place over many years."},
    {k:"p", t:"Liberia has a **tropical climate**: it is hot and wet all year, and it has two seasons – the **rainy season** (about April/May to October) and the **dry season** (about November to March), when the dry **harmattan** wind blows dust from the Sahara."},

    {k:"rule"},
    {k:"h3", t:"Effect of Weather on Living Things"},
    {k:"p", t:"Plants, animals and people all depend on the weather. Too little rain makes hunger; too much rain destroys houses and spreads sickness; great heat dries up the streams."},
    {k:"bul", items:["Crops: some grow in the wet season (rice, cassava, plantain), some in the dry season (vegetables, groundnut).","Animals: fish move with the water; cattle need pasture and water; poultry must be shaded from heat and rain.","People: malaria and diarrhoea rise in the rainy season, coughs and eye trouble in the harmattan."]},
    {k:"rule"},
    {k:"h3", t:"Climate Change"},
    {k:"p", t:"**Climate change** means that the usual weather pattern of the earth is shifting. The earth is getting warmer because people burn wood, charcoal, oil and gas, and because forests are cut down."},

    {k:"rule"},
    {k:"h3", t:"Farming Methods that Protect the Forest"},
    {k:"p", t:"**Slash-and-burn** (swidden) farming is the cutting and burning of bush before planting. It is the common method in Liberia, but when it is repeated every year on the same hill the forest never recovers and the soil is washed away."},
    {k:"bul", items:["**Leave a bush fallow** – let the land rest for many years so forest can grow back.","**Rotate crops** – change the crop planted each season to keep the soil rich.","**Mix crops** – plant beans and groundnut with cassava so the soil keeps its goodness.","**Terrace and ridge** across the slope so rainwater does not carry the soil away.","**Plant trees and grasses** on the boundaries, on the river banks and on the hill tops.","**Protect the forest reserve** – never cut or burn inside it without permission."]},
    {k:"p", t:"**Deforestation** is cutting down the trees of a forest until the land is bare. Bare land gives less rain, fewer birds and poorer harvests."},

The **St. Paul River** at DuBridge and the **St. John River** supply Monrovia with water.","**Lakes and lagoons** – **Lake Piso** near Robertsport, and lagoons along the coast.","**Waterfalls** – **Mineral Win** and **Wewagi (Recess) falls**, **Cumoh Falls** and the falls of the St. Paul at DuBridge.","**Forests** – the tropical rain forest covers nearly half of Liberia and is the largest in West Africa; it gives timber, medicine and bush meat.","**Coast, capes and islands** – **Cape Mount**, **Cape Mesurado** (Monrovia) and **Cape Palmas**; **Bushrod Island** and **Gbin Hill** in Marshall."]},

    {k:"h3", t:"Conflict between Adolescents and Parents or Guardians"},
    {k:"p", t:"An **adolescent** is a young person passing from childhood to adulthood – the body changes, the mind wants to think for itself, and the friends become as important as the family. Quarrel between such a young person and his parents or guardian is common; it is not wicked, and it can be settled."},
    {k:"bul", items:["**Reasons for the conflict** – the demand for freedom and the parents' demand for safety; money for clothes, phone, outing and school fees; the friends, the boyfriend or girlfriend and the parents' choice of who is suitable; the work at home the adolescent refuses; school, marks and the future; dress, hair, music, film and the language of the young; religion, the society and the ceremony the young person does not wish to enter; the favouritism between children, the step-parent, the new baby, and the share of a dead father's property; alcohol, drug, gambling and the money that vanishes; punishment felt to be unfair; and the pressure of the peer and the media against the value of the home.","**Restricting powers in the family** – the authority of a parent to set rules, to limit the hour, the money, the company, the dress, the media and the outing, to require work and school, and to punish moderately. These powers exist to protect and to train a child, not to crush him; the Constitution and the Children's Law forbid cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment, and a child of growing years must be consulted in what concerns him.","**Roles in making a family decision** – the father, the mother and the guardian decide together and each has the last word in his or her charge; the elders and the auntie advise; the boy and the girl are heard, and a fair family lets a child speak before the decision is made and expects him to obey after it; the older adolescent takes more responsibility and receives more freedom, and both move together.","**Conflict resolution by dialogue** – choose the time and the place, not in the middle of anger; begin with respect and with what you agree on; say what you feel and what you want in your own words, without insult or threat; listen until you can repeat the other person's reason; ask for the reason of the rule, and offer a fair trial of your own plan; write down or state the agreement and the condition; and accept the parents' final decision while you ask to try again in a month.","**When to call help** – if there is violence, hunger, an unendurable quarrel, a threat, or the wish to run away, speak to a relative you trust, the teacher, the school counsellor, the pastor or imam, a women's or youth group, or the child helpline; mediation by the elders or a family counsellor is better than leaving home.","**The five habits that prevent most quarrels** – tell the truth, do your work before your pleasure, ask in a civil way, keep your promise, and let the parent see that you can carry a little responsibility."]},
    {k:"p", t:"Peace in a family is not the absence of difference but the presence of respect: the son who obeys today will be the father who is obeyed tomorrow, and he will remember how his father spoke to him."}
