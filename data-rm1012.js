/* Curriculum data — Republic of Liberia, Senior High RELIGIOUS & MORAL
   EDUCATION, Grades 10–12. Extends the national Religious & Moral Education
   progression (data-rm.js, Grades 1–6; data-rm79.js, Grades 7–9) to Senior
   High, 6 periods per grade, so the platform covers the subject Grades 1–12.

   No official Senior High RME guide was supplied with the project, so these
   units are original teaching resources, not a transcription: they spiral the
   themes of the official Elementary and Junior High guides — God and creation,
   worship, reconciliation, peace, chastity, substance abuse, leadership,
   festivals, health — to Senior High depth, in the same multi-religious voice
   the guides require. The WASSCE Christian Religious Studies syllabus is
   transcribed separately (data-wa-crs.js); this file remains MULTI-RELIGIOUS:
   Christian, Islamic and African Traditional teaching are set side by side,
   and learners are asked to compare them with respect.

   Same unit shape as RM_CURRICULUM / RM_CURRICULUM_79 so GEN_RM renders it
   unchanged:
     terms[] {t,d,x} · facts[] {q,a} · tf[] {s,a,why} · apply[] {q,a}
     · sort {title,groups} · compare {title,caption,items} · casestudy
     · project · activities[] · materials[] · assessment[]
   Every unit carries study[] — the course text of the unit, written out as a
   block list (h3 / p / bul / num / table / rule) in the same voice as the
   Grades 1–9 files. `**bold**` marks the key terms (matching the Physics
   convention); table cells take no markup because the renderer escapes them.
   Scripture references are retained as text references only. Per the project
   rule, no online resources are referenced anywhere: the pack must stay fully
   offline.

Some church members objected: \"We bought that land with our offerings.\" The pastor called the church council and read the parable of the good neighbour, then said, \"The land was never ours; it was God's before we bought it and it will be His after. The question is whether the quarter will see two houses of God or one wall.\" The church sold the half-acre at a fair price, and the two communities shared the same mason.

Years later, when the church roof was blown off in a storm, the first people on the scaffold were the young men of the mosque.",

    text:"Old Man Kpana of a River Cess town had been a teacher, a church elder and, in his youth, the keeper of the town's oldest drum. When he died at eighty-four, the family met a pressure every Liberian family knows: borrow for a grand funeral — imported cloth, a marquee, three days of cooking for hundreds — or bury him with dignity within the family's means. His widow, Momaweh, asked for the exercise book in which the old man had written his wishes. It said: \"Bury me as I lived, within my means. Let the church sing, let the drum I kept be played once, let no one borrow one dollar in my name. What you would spend on display, put on my grandchildren's school fees, and visit their mother every Christmas.\" The family obeyed him. The funeral was simple and full — the hymns, the one drum, the whole town walking to the burying ground. The money saved sent two grandchildren through school. Years later, people still quoted the exercise book, and no one could remember a single thing the marquee would have added.",

She recorded a short reply with the clinic's senior nurse stating the vaccine's record and naming the diseases it prevented — and she took it first to the imam of the district's mosque and the pastor of its largest church, who each endorsed it from their own phones. By week's end the queue had returned, led by members of the two congregations. Later a radio presenter asked the teacher whether she had been angry at the rumour. She said, \"Anger forwards itself. Verification is slower, so it needs the rest of us to carry it.\"",
    questions:[
      {q:"What did the voice note get right about people, and wrong about facts?", a:"Right — people love their children and fear for them; wrong — the vaccine's tested record and the clinic's motive; a lie rides a true love to a false destination."},
      {q:"Why did the teacher take her recording to the imam and the pastor first?", a:"Because trusted voices carry further than correct ones: the congregations' trust in their leaders carried the verified fact through the same networks the rumour had used."},
      {q:"Explain the teacher's last sentence.", a:"Rumour is fast because anger forwards itself; verification is slow and needs deliberate bearers — the community must organise truth the way lies organise themselves."},
      {q:"What guard-rails of this unit did the district practise?", a:"Verification before forwarding; respected leadership applied to the digital road; and the protection of the young as the first claim."}

We do not confess Him as God. You do. That difference is old, and it will not be solved at this table — and the Qur'an also tells me to argue in the best manner and to speak to your people kindly. So here is what I propose: let us both be commanded by what our books agree on — that God is one, that the poor must be fed, and that we will each answer for our own souls — and let us compete in that.\" The Christian student stood and said, \"On that, my Lord agrees with your book.\" The forum ended with the two schools planning a joint feeding of a displaced families' centre that Christmas.",

They had prayed and fasted in Monrovia through the worst of the war, Christian and Muslim women in one movement, and they followed the talks to Accra. When the delegates stalled, the women sat at the door of the hall and refused to let the delegates leave without an agreement, day after day, armed with nothing but their presence, their songs and their white dress. One of their leaders said later that their strength had two sources: they were mothers, and they refused to be divided — the war had tried to divide Christian from Muslim, and the women answered by praying together in both traditions. The agreement was signed in August 2003.

An old woman of the zoes' line answered them with a walk.

You will sell one forest and buy two problems: a dry well and a dead school.\" The town sat three palavers and reached a third way: they marked the grove's boundary as the old rule had it, and sold instead a plantation stand of planted pines further down, which they replanted from their own nursery.

A nurse's aide brought her savings; a market woman brought her stock money; a schoolfather brought the fees. Forty days later nothing had returned, and the preacher had moved to another county. The market woman could not restock and her table stood empty for a season; the schoolfather's daughter missed a term. The quarter's own pastor had stayed away from the crusade, and when the families came to him ashamed, he did not mock them. He read them the widow of Zarephath — whose last meal was blessed, not bought — and 2 Corinthians 9:7, that God loves a cheerful giver, and no verse prices a promise. Then he did the practical thing: the church's deacons restocked the market woman's table as a loan without interest, and the school's PTA carried the fees. \"The false prophet took their money,\" he said. \"If we only preach at them and do not restock the table, he has taken their hope too, and that will cost more to replace.\"",

    text:"Musu finished senior high in Grand Bassa with no money for university and a certificate in science. Her five-year plan, written in the back of her exercise book and read by her old pastor, had four lines: work, save, study nursing by part-time classes, and return to serve. Line one took her to a private clinic as an aide, where she asked the senior nurse to teach her everything and was known within a year as the aide who never missed a shift. Line two was the hardest: two cousins needed school fees, and her savings were their savings. But she had shown the plan to her pastor and her imam neighbour — and when her savings were spent on the cousins, the two congregations quietly took up her nursing fees together, saying the plan was theirs now too. In her sixth year she passed her certification, and in her ninth she was the senior nurse of the clinic where she had first cleaned the floor, with two aides of her own — each of them holding a copy of her four-line plan, because she wrote it on the first page of every orientation book she gave them.",

  note:"<b>Why do I exist?</b> The Preacher searched everything under the sun and ended at the beginning: \"fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man\" (Ecclesiastes 12:13). Jesus said He came \"that they may have life, and have it abundantly\" (John 10:10), and summed the Law in love of God and neighbour (Matthew 22:37-40). The Qur'an states it in a sentence: \"I did not create jinn and mankind except to worship Me\" (Qur'an 51:56). The tradition answers with the <b>full life</b> — old age, children, a good name, a home that fed the stranger. All four answers agree in this: <b>the life is God's, and its meaning is found in Him and in the neighbour He commands us to love.</b>",

    text:"At the end of every year, the RME teacher of a Monrovia senior-high class did one unusual thing: she asked each graduating pupil to bring the personal code written in the back of their oldest exercise book — the one from Grade 10 — and to read it aloud, with the class voting nothing and judging nothing. One year, a pupil named Flomo read his: five lines, written at fifteen, about honesty, the body, the tongue, money and his mother. He had kept four lines, he said, and failed the tongue — a forwarded rumour in Grade 11 that had hurt a classmate, and the apology that followed. He read that too. When the readings were done, the teacher said, \"Religious and Moral Education ends today for you, or it does not. The syllabus is finished. The code is not. Keep the reading — one evening a year, alone or with your partner — and the exercise book will finish by becoming true.\" Years later, former pupils still wrote to her on the same month each year, with their line kept or failed and repaired. She called these letters \"the library being built\".",
    questions:[
      {q:"Why did the teacher have the codes read from the Grade 10 book, not recopied?", a:"Because the old page is the evidence — the handwriting of the fifteen-year-old faces the person who kept or failed it; honesty needs the document."},
