/* Teacher's Lesson Plan and Weekly Unit Plan builder.
   Fills the standard Liberian lesson and weekly unit plans for each selected
   period, according to the regular Liberia school sector unit duration (3 or 4 weeks).
   Supports both:
     1. Daily Plan: Day-by-day lesson plans across the unit's 3 or 4 weeks until completed,
        with weekly plan adjustments, stage timings (Introduction / Main activities / Summary /
        Evaluation summing to the lesson duration), aids, methods, evaluation and assignments.
     2. Weekly Plan: Comprehensive Teacher's Weekly Unit Plan with week-by-week unit breakdown
        (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4 / until unit completion), weekly objectives, procedures,
        teacher aids, methods, weekly plan adjustments, evaluations, and period culmination.

   Emits the SAME block model as the gen-*.js engines (so the screen renderer,
   the print layout and the .docx exporter are shared) plus one new block kind,
   "formtable": a bordered table with no header row, for the form fields.
   Registered on window.LESSON_PLAN; called by app.js when the Document type
