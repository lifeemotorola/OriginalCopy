/* Curriculum data — Republic of Liberia, Elementary GENERAL SCIENCE, Grades 1–6
   Derived from the "General Science 1-6" curriculum guide (78 pp.), 6 periods per grade.

   Every unit carries a `study[]` block list — the course text of the guide,
   rendered verbatim on the Study Notes page (see data-sc79.js for the Junior
   High half of the same subject). `**bold**` marks the key terms; table cells
   take no markup because the renderer escapes them.

   Units are ordered by the guide's own grade/period split, and each unit's
   `study[]` must teach that unit's own topic. Grade 4 is the guide's pp. 38-49
   (Energy · Force · Measurement · Satellites · Skin/Soil/Malaria · Health and
   Personal Hygiene) and Grade 5 is pp. 50-63 (Simple Machines · Sound and
   Light · Health Lessons · Organization of Life · Structure of Matter ·
   Weather and Climate) — keep the `grade:` field, the guide page comment and
   the notes in step when editing, and see the spot facts in
   tests/notes-verbatim.js, which pin them.

   Science is a CONCEPT + INQUIRY subject, so each topic carries:
     terms[]     {t, d, x}                 key term, definition, example/where seen
     facts[]     {q, a}                    short-answer recall questions
     tf[]        {s, a(true|false), why}   true/false statements
     classify    {title, groups:[{name, items:[]}]}   sorting / grouping task
     diagram     {title, caption, parts:[{p, f}]}     label-and-function table
     experiment  {title, aim, materials:[], steps:[], expect, why}
