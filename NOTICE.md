# Notice — what is yours, what is not, what is risky

This file exists because the platform bundles three different kinds of
material, and a buyer's lawyer will separate them within ten minutes. Being
explicit about it is worth more than any feature on the platform.

## 1. Original material (yours to sell)

- All application code (`app.js`, `gen-*.js`, `teaching.js`, `lesson.js`,
  `voice.js`, `ai.js`, `usage.js`, `brand.js`, `book.js`, `toc.js`,
  `cover-text.js`, `humancheck.js`, `build.sh`, `styles.css`, `body.html`,
  `tests/`).
- The `.docx` writer, the A4 pagination engine, the cover designer, the
  exercise generators and the deterministic seed scheme.
- **Original teaching content**, written for this project:
  - Civics, Grades 7–12 — 36 units (`data-ci.js`). No Civics syllabus was
    supplied, so these are original resources, not an official transcription.
  - Computer Science, Grades 1–12 — 72 units (`data-cs.js` for Grades 1–6,
    `data-cs79.js` for Grades 7–9, `data-cs1012.js` for Grades 10–12). No
    Computer Science syllabus was supplied, so these are original
    unplugged-first / paper-first teaching resources, not an official
    transcription. Teacher review against the school's scheme of work is
    required.
  - Senior High History, Grades 10–12 — 18 units of original explanatory
    notes aligned to the uploaded guide (`data-hi.js`), with source file and
    page numbers recorded per unit.

## 2. Transcribed Ministry of Education material (NOT yours — licensed use only)

Fifteen subjects carry study notes and course text **transcribed verbatim from
the official Liberian National Curriculum guides**: English, Phonics, French,
General Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, Religious & Moral Education,
Physical Education (Grades 1–9 and 1–12 where stated), and Biology, Chemistry,
Physics, Economics, English Grammar, Geography, Literature (Grades 10–12).

The underlying curriculum is the property of the **Ministry of Education,
Republic of Liberia**. What you own is the transcription, selection,
structuring and the surrounding generated material — not the curriculum.

**Consequences for a sale:**

- You cannot grant a buyer *exclusive* rights to Liberian curriculum content.
  Nobody can.
- A buyer receives your transcription and your platform, and needs their own
  relationship with the MoE for the underlying curriculum — which, for a
  ministry, publisher or donor, they either already have or can obtain.
- Say this out loud in the sale memorandum. Volunteering it builds more trust
  than being caught on it, and it costs you nothing.

## 3. Third-party material and marks (check before you ship)

| Item | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **WASSCE / WAEC** name and syllabus structure | "WASSCE" and "WAEC" are marks of the **West African Examinations Council**. The WASSCE track is practice material aligned to publicly available syllabi, **not** official WAEC past papers. | Do not imply endorsement. Keep the "original practice assessments, not official WAEC past papers" wording in the UI and in any marketing. |
| **PDFs in `uploads/`** (English 1-6.pdf, Chemistry 10-12.pdf, Economics 10-12.pdf, ENGLISH GRAMMAR 10-12.pdf, ECE curriculum PDFs, the 2025–26 academic calendar) | Third-party / MoE documents used as transcription sources. ~23 MB. **Not licensed for redistribution.** | Exclude `uploads/` from any distributed or sold bundle. Keep it as your private source folder, or ship it only with written MoE permission. |
| **Groq** (AI model provider) | Service provider. The API key lives only in the Cloudflare Worker/Pages secret — never in the browser or in this repo. | Buyer must open their own Groq account; the tutor stops working at handover until they do. |
| **Cloudflare** (Pages, Workers, Turnstile) | Service provider, free tiers in use. | Buyer takes over the account, or you migrate the proxy to their host. |
| **Liberia flag / map emblem** in `assets/icons/` | A national symbol drawn for this project. | Fine to use; do not claim it as a trade mark. |
| **`assets/emmanuel.png`** and the tutor name | A personal name and portrait currently wired into `ai.js` and the header. | Now white-labelled: set `window.APP_BRAND = { tutor: "…" }` (see `brand.js`) before shipping to a licensee. Replace the portrait if the buyer supplies their own. |

## 4. What is still undecided (owner decisions, not engineering)

- **Copyright holder name** — `LICENSE` still says `[OWNER LEGAL NAME — REPLACE
  BEFORE PUBLISHING]`. A company, a sole proprietor, or a co-founder changes
  who signs the sale agreement and who pays tax on it.
- **Contributor provenance** — confirm there are no other authors with a claim
  (contractors, co-teachers who wrote content, anyone paid in cash). If there
  are, get a short written assignment **before** a buyer finds them.
- **Trade mark** — the product name is unregistered. Registration in Liberia
  is inexpensive relative to the sale price and removes the last "what exactly
  am I buying?" question.
- **Curriculum alignment review** — a written MoE or county education office
  review of the 36 Civics, 72 Computer Science and 18 History units converts "original, unverified"
  into "reviewed", which is worth more than any feature on this list.
