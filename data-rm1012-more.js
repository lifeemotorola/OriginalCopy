/* Senior High RELIGIOUS & MORAL EDUCATION — depth supplement, Grades 10–12.
   Brings each unit in data-rm1012.js closer to the depth of the Physics
   units (data-ph.js): extra course-text sections, a larger glossary, more
   recall and true/false items, and a `worked[]` bank — the RME counterpart
   of Physics' worked calculations: a moral or scriptural problem solved
   step by step {q, steps[], a}, rendered by GEN_RM as the
   "Worked moral reasoning" sheet.

   Each entry is matched to its unit by grade + period. Study blocks are
   inserted just before the unit's "Assignment" heading so the assignment
   stays last. Same multi-religious voice and offline rule as the base file:
   Scripture references are text references only. */
